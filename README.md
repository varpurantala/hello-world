# hello-world
# Above, there is the headline of the repository, hello-world. in this second edit, I note that I have deleted the description of the repository ("Description"). 
# I do not know why this text is BOLD. 
# The earlier version went like this (added some edits):"These (the headline and the description) were the initial contents of the readme-file, which was saved in the master version (probably the "initail commit"). I am now working on a branch, that is, a version that, at first, duplicates, and second, alters the master version. The branch helps to distinguish ongoing work (e.g. fixing a bug) from the master version during the reparation/addition process. This text that I am writing here is called _commit_ - it will be a saved change to the master version. It will be merged with the master version in the end. I have also defined an issue ("Finish README" (so that humans geet me)). _Issue_ is a note that something in the repository needs attention. As said, my issue is Finish README (which is what I am doing right now: I am adding description of what is going on, into the README-file). This work is conducted in a _branch_, and when I am finished with this README-description, I will merge the branch with the master. Before that, there will be a _Pull request_, however. In the pull request, I can compare between the master and branch version.
