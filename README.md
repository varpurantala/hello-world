# hello-world
# Above, there is the headline of the repository, hello-world, and the description of the repository ("Description"). These were the initial contents of the readme-file, which was saved in themaster version (probably as "inital commit"). I am now working on a branch, that is, a version that, at first, duplicates, and second, alters the master version. This text that I am writing here is calledcommit - it will become a saved change to the master version. It will be merged with the master version in the end. I have also defined an issue (which says, "Finish README" (so that humans geet me)). Issue is a note that something in the repository needs attention. My issue is "Finish README", which is what I am doing right now: I am adding description of what is going on, into the README-file - I am working on finishing a README -file. This work is conducted in a branch, and when I am finished with this README-description, I will merge the branch with the master. Before that, there will be a Pull request, however. The branch helps to distinguish ongoing work (e.g. fixing a bug) from the master version during the reparation/addition process.
